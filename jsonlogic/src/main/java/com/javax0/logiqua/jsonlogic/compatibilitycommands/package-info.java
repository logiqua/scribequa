/**
 * This package contains JsonLogic compatibility command implementations for the Logiqua expression engine.
 * <p>
 * The commands in this package provide JsonLogic-compatible behavior while integrating with
 * the Logiqua execution engine. Each class implements specific JsonLogic operations.
 * <p>
 * These implementations ensure compatibility with the JsonLogic specification while leveraging
 * Logiqua's execution framework.
 * <p>
 * The class names are prefixed with {@code JL} to avoid name clashes with the Logiqua implementations.
